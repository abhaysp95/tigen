* give thought to use move constructor or not
* if move constructor used then whether it'll be explicit or not
* whether to use explicit copy constructor or not(using non-explicit copy constructor currently)
* Think about whether to use(or whether it could be used) initializer_list or not
* see the places where you can return const entities as return(like entities::room& function())
